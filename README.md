# Malicious Url Detection Using LSTM
## Introduction
Our project involves creating a Chrome extension that utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to block malicious URLs. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data like URLs, as it can learn patterns and dependencies over time. The extension will likely analyze the URL patterns and characteristics, feeding them into the LSTM model, which will then classify them as malicious or safe. When a user attempts to visit a URL, the extension will consult the LSTM model to determine if it's safe to proceed or if it should be blocked to protect the user from potential threats. This approach combines machine learning with browser functionality to enhance cybersecurity for users.
